# resume-portfolio-site
This is my personal resume and portfolio site. I decided to build myself a custom theme selector (the little boxes up at the top right of the screen).

## Goals
- Project section that listed all projects I have been involved with over the years.
- Ability to click on each item and each tag to generate a list of projects that are involved with that tag.
- Theming ability so people can experience the site using a style of their choice.

I wanted to build a project listing page and tag system to easily display skills and project linked to those skills. I believe having a direct tag and listing project list helps achieve that.

You can check this project out on my personal website: [eriktodd.me](https://eriktodd.me/)
